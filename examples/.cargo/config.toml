# Local development override:
# Use this file only if you have the `lnmp` repo checked out adjacent to
# `lnmp-examples` (sibling folder) so `path` dependencies work for local dev
# without having to publish crates. If your local checkout is named
# `lnpm-protocol` (older name), uncomment the alternative lines below.
# Patch to redirect git dependencies to local path for development.

# Example for CI: if using crates.io or git dependency you can remove this
# file or omit it in CI by not copying it.
