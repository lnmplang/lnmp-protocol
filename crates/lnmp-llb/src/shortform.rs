//! LNMP-ShortForm encoding and parsing (planned)
//!
//! This module will provide ShortForm encoding for extreme token reduction.
//! ShortForm omits the 'F' prefix and optionally type hints to achieve
//! 7-12× token reduction compared to JSON.
//!
//! WARNING: ShortForm is NOT canonical LNMP and should only be used for
//! LLM input optimization, never for storage or APIs.

// Placeholder for future ShortForm implementation
// See examples/shortform.rs for conceptual usage
